v1.3.0 — <em>Smarter scans & deterministic decorations</em>

### Highlights

- 🧠 Smarter scanning: major performance boost for large-area scans and many structure types—smoother gameplay, cleaner road graphs, and more reliable structure detection.
- 🌲 Deterministic decorations: consistent, per-path placement of decorations (lamps, buoys, side pieces) across chunk loads—less pop-in and cleaner chunk borders. Also fixes common issues like floating fence posts or off-grid buoys.
- 💡 New Lamp decorations: fresh styles and better fence integration where appropriate.
- 🧭 Debug map: shows your position and direction (red dot + arrow).
- ⚙️ New settings (all loaders):
    - Lamp interval
    - Side decoration interval
    - Buoy interval
    - Mask erosion near land/water transitions
    - Toggle for deterministic decorations
- 🛤️ Smoother road profiles: post-processing reduces spikes and clamps extreme slopes for cleaner elevation transitions.
- 🌐 Localization & UI: updated strings (EN/RU/ES/FR/DE/ZH) and a small progress-stage label fix (“initialisation”).

**Compatibility:** No breaking changes; existing worlds remain compatible.
