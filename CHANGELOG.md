v1.3.0 â€” <em>Smarter structure scanning</em>

### Highlights

- ðŸ§  Smarter scanning: major performance boost for large-area scans and many structure typesâ€”smoother gameplay, cleaner road graphs, and more reliable structure detection.
- ðŸš§ Fences now place correctly: posts automatically shift up to free space and extend down until they rest on solid groundâ€”no more floating or sticking-out posts.
- ðŸ›Ÿ Mini-patch: more accurate buoy placement.
- ðŸ§­ Debug map: shows your position and direction (red dot + arrow).

**Compatibility:** No breaking changes; existing worlds remain compatible.
